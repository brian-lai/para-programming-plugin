# Plan: {TASK_NAME}

**Plan Key:** {PLAN_KEY}
**Date:** {DATE}
**Status:** In Review

## Objective

[Clear statement of what needs to be accomplished]

## Approach

[Step-by-step methodology for implementation]

1. [First major step]
2. [Second major step]
3. [Third major step]

## Risks & Edge Cases

[Potential issues to watch out for]

- **Risk 1:** [Description and mitigation]
- **Risk 2:** [Description and mitigation]

## Data Sources

[Required files, APIs, or external data]

- [Source 1]: [Purpose]
- [Source 2]: [Purpose]

## MCP Tools

[Preprocessing tools to be used]

- `context/servers/{tool}.ts` - [Purpose]

## Relevant Files

This section tracks all relevant source files for smart context loading. These files will be automatically injected into Claude's context when working on this plan.

### Repositories
- `{repo-name}` - [Brief description of the repo]

### Files to Track
- `{repo-name}/path/to/file1` - [Why this file is relevant]
- `{repo-name}/path/to/file2` - [Why this file is relevant]
- `{repo-name}/path/to/file3` - [Why this file is relevant]

### Rationale
[Explain why these specific files are needed for this work. This helps maintain focus and avoid context bloat.]

**Note:** Files tracked here will be added to `active_context.{PLAN_KEY}.files` in `context/context.md` for automatic context injection.

## Success Criteria

[Measurable outcomes that define completion]

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

## Implementation Steps

[Detailed breakdown of execution]

1. **[Step 1 Name]**
   - [Sub-task]
   - [Sub-task]

2. **[Step 2 Name]**
   - [Sub-task]
   - [Sub-task]

3. **[Step 3 Name]**
   - [Sub-task]
